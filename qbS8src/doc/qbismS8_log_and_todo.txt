2011-05-22
Fixed-point D_DrawSpans based on Jakko Biker/ Dan East code in PocketQuake.  Looks bad above 320x240 res.
Fix for very low res, untested, also from Dan East
Set physics to min(cl_maxfps.value, 72)

2011-05-15
MH's latest Host_ServerFrame, framerate-independent physics
engoo shadowhack, stainmap shadowhack.  Just playing, may omit.

2011-04-09
Load TGA skymaps
Removed reliance on ancient dxsdk (actually some time ago but now removed from compile search path)


2011-03-22
Process input from keyboard/mouse/etc. before possible host_filtertime return, possibly improves responsiveness.


2011-03-18
Change from mh's dib vid_win.c to mh's directx version, to allow vid modes that aren't a multiple of 4.  Silly dib.
Loadpalette loads tweaked palette lmp from /gfx and regenerates colormap.


2011-01-09
Start alternate palette loading code.  TODO- should become similar to loadsky, via map or keyboard.
Added FitzQ MTU limitation.  Verify protocol OK in actual multiplayer.

2011-01-07
Remove net_vcr code

2011-01-01
Added r_fisheye and ffov (fisheye fov)
Deleted or implemented #ifdef Quake2 lines

2010-12-21
Add sv_cheats, including coop

2010-12-18
Better particle sizing from Makaqu 1.4
Switch to square particles, remove aspect compensation.  Faster speed, but kept alpha

2010-11-18
Fixed rotating brush bug in Makaqu
Rotating brush fix - Avirox + Baker tute

2010-11-16
Additional span loop tweaking from mh and mk.
Show fps as float
Change physics throttle to: servertime = 1/max(cl_maxfps.value, 20);  Otherwise can slo-mo at low fps.

2010-11-03
Fixed issue of transparent entities with non-alpha progs.dat.  Hopefully did not break it for others.
Going w/ codeblocks, drop vc++

2010-10-30
Remove d_fill.c from project (not used)

2010-10-27
Change drawspans from 8 to 16, a little speed-up.  Unroll inner loop thanks to mh, a little more speed-up!
AddMap from bpj to run quoth with a mod (dual mod directories)
Large Brushmodel Flickering/Not Visible Fix by mh.
Plays bigmaps!  Release 'Halloween Special'!

2010-10-22
Plays mh's 400 knights map

2010-10-18
Clipnode fix (m_clipnotes) for SV_HullPointContents SV_RecursiveHullCheck needed for more than 32768 clipnodes in a map, thanks to mh!  Fixed func_walls and func_plats seeming to behave like SOLID_NOT.   

2010-10-16
Expanded use of alpha to PF_makestatic and baseline entity creation.  Added float alpha to entity_t.

2010-10-09
Looks like bigmap support is working now for some maps.  Sill testing.  Just some minor completion to protocol thanks to Fitzquake and Baker documentation.  Note, the protocol is similar but not identical to Fitzquake protocol.
Looked at issue with skyboxes- if map is compiled with a skybox set and properly formatted skybox is not present (requires pcx files!) it will crash.  Should perhaps load a dummy texture instead.  Some maps have tga skybox textures that will work after conversion to Quake-palletized pcx.

2010-10-06
physics rate throttling based on mh idea and code.  Used cl_maxfps with bounds instead of cvar
cut back min memory requirements a bit
note to self:  gprof qbismS8debug.exe gmon.out >out.txt

2010-09-19
Created Code::Blocks mingw project
Updated code-only alpha release.

2010-09-16
Reset ent->baseline.effects on server and client side whenever effects change.  So only sends an update if effects change.  Todo- This optimization is sensitive to dropped packets.
Changed QB_PROTOCOL to send a long (4-byte) message for effects as required for modelflags extension.
Added dp_extension sv_modelflags_as_effects, so qc can now change these effects.  See my tute on inside3d!
The one-line ProQuake NAT Fix thanks to Baker, untested.
Fixed loadsky sprintf problem with a Q_ function.
Custom chase thanks to frag.machine tute

2010-08-22
Additional dp_extensions:  drawonlytoclient nodrawtoclient exteriormodeltoclient
(drawonlytoclient is untested)

2010-06-20
Added sorting from Reckless
Change fps from 20 to 60 in Flash project(!)
Added define FLASHDEMO for compiling a demo-only-mode Flash port.  FIXME/ limitation- only plays one demo.

2010-06-18
Start cleaning up GL and DC ifdefs
Start cleaning unused functions/cvars- vid_unlockbuffer, showturtle, etc.

2010-06-14
Alpha release

2010-06-10
Misc. clean-up, getting ready to release alpha.

2010-05-03
Simplify video modes menu, no more setting defaults.
Do away with Draw_BeginDisc.  It errored out on alt-tab, etc.  Not really needed nowadays.

2010-04-21
Normalize console drop-down speed to be consistent at all resolutions.  From GoldQuake.

2010-04-19
Melded mh vid_win.c, no more MGL
Converted mh touch fix (teleporters, etc)
Finished adding MOVETYPE_FOLLOW and MOVETYPE_BOUNCEMISSILE, tested with Junrall's RicoSpikes, fun!

2010-02-27
Extended coordinate range (long instead of short) - JTR quakesrc tute
Audio sample rate to 44100

2010-02-24
Increased max_model upper limit via protocol change.
Undid dynamic efrags.
Flash does not seem happy with dynamic memory allocation.

2010-02-21
"map *" + TAB lists all maps!

2010-02-20
Finally fixed crash during waypoint loading, thanks Spike + inside3d!
...had to undo dynamic zone
Increased zone buffer to 256k
Added svc_say, TODO intent is to print this differently in future
Un-ifdefed MOVETYPE_BOUNCEMISSILE, needs testing
Added FOV slider, and move view model based on FOV 

2010-02-13
Tools used-
qc compiler: fteqcc.exe
qc editor: qcIDE
c compiler: VC++ 2008
map editor:  Quark

2010-02-12
Added console backscrolling (from FETT- quakesrc.org tute)
Added teleporting projectiles (from Ursader- inside3d tute)
Game starts with menu instead of credits.

2010-02-07
Adjusted engine limits upward, looking at QSB, Qrack, and Fitzquake, but below the threshold of crashing Flash.

2010-02-06
Merged-in Makaqu 1.3 (qbS8 originally based on 1.2) The difference is mainly entity effects.  Did not merge input changes between 1.2 and 1.3.
EF_REFLECTION, EF_CELSHADING, and EF_ADDITIVE confirmed to work in a simple test on rotating items.  EF_SHADOW was strange, item mostly invisible, then crash... need to learn more about it!

2010-02-02
clean out i386 ifdefs (assembler)
Replacements: Q_strncpy, Q_strlen, Q_atof, Q_strcat, Q_strcmp, (Q_memcpy, Q_memset later removed, not needed)
Q_strcasecmp, Q_strncasecmp, Q_strcpy

2010-01-31
Added parameter tab completion from Qrack (mostly orignally from Joequake).  Tested with maps, even finds maps in wads!  Need to test other tab-complete items.

2010-01-28
Removed IDGODS
Change Sys_FloatTime to Sys_DoubleTime (which is what it is...)
Added Baker save avi capture tute.  Works best in windowed mode with capture_hack set to 1 or more.
Added movetype_follow from Darkplaces, but untested yet.

2010-01-24
Stainmaps adapted from fteqw.  Commented with ftestain.

2010-01-20
add QB_PROTOCOL for more entities and sounds (needs testing)

2010-01-18
FOV fix for widescreen (mh)
Command and cvar listing for tab autocomplete (partial featureset of joequake/qrack)
Centerprint logging to console (fitzquake)

2010-01-17
Remove static entity and efrag limits [Note:  Due to Flash crashing, this has been undone!]
Remove zone limitations per mh tute [Note:  this has been undone!]

TODO... 'fix', 'wish' or 'maybe, maybe not' list:
'give' : why not armor?
Support mp3 and/or ogg music playing
Epand font and overlay graphics size by 2,3, or 4 depending on video mode width.
Alpha entities - plats, func_walls, etc. (MK has started this in Makaqu 1.4)
Can't drag window since moving to ddraw implementation.  Compare to dib version.
Check timefrag2 for ideas.  Lipsync?  Text-to-speech?  Integrated multi-part models?  The idea of generating lipsync sequence and speech from basic text strings is interesting.  But how much talking do we really want in an FPS?
SV_StartLocalSound from timefrag-  Plays a local sound to a specific client, others can't hear it.  Was this from a tute?  Equivalent to any DP extension?
