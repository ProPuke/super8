Notes
=======================================================
[+]  denotes new commands or features as compared to the GPL licensed Quake source code.

Autocomplete:  Type the first few letters of a command or variable and then 'TAB' key.  The command will autocomplete, or list possible alternatives.  Certain arguments will autocomplete, including map names and demo file names.  For example, type 'map a' then 'TAB', and all maps starting with 'a' will be listed.  Type 'map *' to list all maps.

To display the current value of a console variable (cvar):  Simply type the command without a value.

General Commands
=======================================================
clear  - clears the console screen
[+] cmdlist [name] lists commands starting with name.  If no name, list all commands.


Alias
=======================================================
alias [name] [command]
Using alias without the [command] option will erase the alias specified in [name].

From techinfo.txt:
	The alias command is used to create a reference to a command or list
	of commands. When aliasing multiple commands, or commands that contain
	multiple words (such as "fraglimit 50"), you must enclose all the
	commands in quotation marks and separate each command with a
	semi-colon.

Example of an alias that changes some Deathmatch server parameters:

alias net_game "hostname my_server ; fraglimit 15 ; timelimit 15"
bind INS net_game

Now, the INS key will execute the alias 'net_game'.


Bind
=======================================================
bind [key] [command]

Used to bind a set of commands to a key.

To bind multiple command enclose the entire command in quotes and separate the commands with semicolons:

bind q "impulse 7; +attack; wait; -attack; impulse 5"

When using actions commands in a bind (ie +attack or +left) the first action will automatically be stopped when the key is released. To prevent this, start the command with a semicolon:

bind q ";+mlook" (This will keep mlook on until a -mlook is executed.)

From techinfo.txt:

	Where [key] is a valid key control and [command] is a valid
	Quake command.

Example:
To bind the j key to the 'jump' command, you would type:
bind j +jump
and press enter.

Non-printable keys such as 'page up' and buttons from the
mouse/joystick are bound in the same manner as printable
characters.

Example:
To bind the page up key to the 'jump' command, you would type:
bind pageup +jump
and press enter.

To bind the right mouse button to the attack command, you would type:
bind mouse2 +attack
and press enter.

The following keys can be bound:
A-Z 0-9
*F1-F12 *TAB
ENTER SPACE
BACKSPACE UPARROW
DOWNARROW LEFTARROW
RIGHTARROW ALT
CTRL SHIFT
INSDEL
PGDN PGUP
HOME END
PAUSE SEMICOLON
MOUSE1 (mouse button 1)
MOUSE2 (mouse button 2)
MOUSE3 (mouse button 3)
*~ (tilde)

* Can only be bound on the command line or in a .cfg file.
The ESC key cannot be bound.


Memory
=======================================================



Server
=======================================================
ban [ip address] [mask]

At long last you can ban those troublesome players. Just get their ip with the status command and enter it in. However, don't get your hopes up that much at this point. It is a quick hack and can only current handle one banned ip address. It also supports higher order domain banning to make it easy to ban players from a particular ISP or site. Once you have declared at least one banned site typing ban without an ip address will list the current sites that are being banned.

To use the higher order domain banning the format is: ban xxx.xxx.0.0 xxx.xxx.0.0 (yes you have to type twice)

Once banning has been turned on you can turn it off by using the command: ban off

fov [value]  - Sets field of view in degrees.  Set to 90 +/- in fisheye mode.

[+] r_fisheye[value]  - Render in fisheye mode.  The engine renders 6 views at 90 degrees, like the sides of a cube, and warps them into a fisheye lens view.
