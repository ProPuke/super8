qbismSuper8 console commands
-----------------------------
[+] indicates a command that is added or altered compared to original Quake.
Note that some original Quake commands have been removed, especially obsolete networking controls.

For commands that take arguments, type the name in the console for more information.  For example, "record" will output:
record <demoname> [<map> [cd track]]


Much credit and thanks to the classic Quake console references produced by Niklata and Daniel Rinehart.
