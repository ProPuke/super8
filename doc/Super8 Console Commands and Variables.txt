1.  Notes

    This command list is based on Quake Console Command Pages by Daniel Rinehart
    http://www.neophi.com/home/danielr/quake/console.html
    and Quake Console Commands by JakFrost
    http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/console/commands/quake.html
    This symbol [+] denotes a new or modified feature in Super8, compared to the GPL licensed Quake source code.
    Autocomplete:  Type the first few letters of a command or variable and then 'TAB' key.  The command will autocomplete, or list possible alternatives.  Certain arguments will autocomplete, including map names and demo file names.  For example, type 'map a' then 'TAB', and all maps starting with 'a' will be listed.  Type 'map *' to list all maps.
    To display the current value of a console variable (cvar):  Simply type the command without a value.

2.  General Console Commands

clear - clears the console screen
[+] cmdlist [name] lists commands starting with name. If no name, list all commands.

[+] cvarlist[name] - Lists cvars starting with name. If none, list all cvars. Server cvars are noted with "S", archive cvars with "*"

echo [string] - Print text to your own console.
help - Bring up the help system (like pressing F1.)
path - Show what file paths Quake is using.
pause - Pause and unpause the game.
ping - Find the ping time to the server and to all other connected players.
quit - Exit the game no questions asked.
status - Report current game information.

say [string] - Broadcast a string to all other players. The string is entered on the console, unlike the messagemode and messagemode2 commands, allowing it to be used on a dedicated server. Thanks to Robert Coward INF-SP for improved documentation of this command.

say_team [string] - Broadcast a string to all players on your team. The string is entered on the console, unlike the messagemode and messagemode2 commands, allowing it to be used on a dedicated server. Thanks to Robert Coward INF-SP for improved documentation of this command.

skill [level] - Set the skill level of the game. Useful to set before recording a demo, or manually loading a single-player map.   Also used by some multiplayer mods.
Value Difficulty
0 Easy
1 Normal
2 Hard
3 Nightmare

slist - Show Quake servers located on the LAN.
tell [player] [string] - Send a message to a single player. Very nice in large network games.

toggleconsole - Display or remove the console screen.
version - Report version information.

wait - Wait a game tic. Typically used within alias commands.

 
3.  Alias

alias [name] [command]
Using alias without the [command] option will erase the alias specified in [name].

From techinfo.txt:
The alias command is used to create a reference to a command or list
of commands. When aliasing multiple commands, or commands that contain
multiple words (such as "fraglimit 50"), you must enclose all the
commands in quotation marks and separate each command with a
semi-colon.

Example of an alias that changes some Deathmatch server parameters:

alias net_game "hostname my_server ; fraglimit 15 ; timelimit 15"
bind INS net_game

Now, the INS key will execute the alias 'net_game'.

 
4.  Bind

bind [key] [command]  - Assign a command or a set of commands to a key. To bind multiple commands to a key, enclose the commands in double-quotes (") and separate them with semicolons (;). To bind bind keys which do not produce any characters use the key's name to bind to it.

Examples:
bind q "impulse 7; +attack; wait; -attack; impulse 5"
bind h "echo Hi Foo!"
bind mouse1 "+attack;+jump;wait;-jump;-attack;echo Foo!"

When using actions commands in a bind (ie +attack or +left) the first action will automatically be stopped when the key is released. To prevent this, start the command with a semicolon:
bind q ";+mlook" (This will keep mlook on until a -mlook is executed.)

From techinfo.txt:
Where [key] is a valid key control and [command] is a valid
Quake command.

Example: To bind the j key to the 'jump' command, you would type:
bind j +jump
and press enter.

Non-printable keys such as 'page up' and buttons from the
mouse/joystick are bound in the same manner as printable
characters.

The following keys can be bound: ALT, AUX1, AUX10, AUX11, AUX12, AUX13, AUX14, AUX15, AUX16, AUX17, AUX18, AUX19, AUX2, AUX20, AUX21, AUX22, AUX23, AUX24, AUX25, AUX26, AUX27, AUX28, AUX29, AUX3, AUX30, AUX31, AUX32, AUX4, AUX5, AUX6, AUX7, AUX8, AUX9, BACKSPACE, CTRL, DEL, DOWNARROW, END, ENTER, ESCAPE, F1, F10, F11, F12, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, HOME, INS, JOY1, JOY2, JOY3, JOY4, LEFTARROW, MOUSE1, MOUSE2, MOUSE3, MWHEELDOWN, MWHEELUP, PAUSE, PGDN, PGUP, RIGHTARROW, SEMICOLON, SHIFT, SPACE, TAB, UPARROW.
The ESCAPE, and ~ (tilde) keys can only be bound from an external configuration file.

[+] bindable  - Show list of keys that could be bound.
[+] bindshift  - Bind command to a SHIFTed key.
unbind [key] - Remove the current commands bound to a key.

unbindall - Remove every key binding.  (Use with caution. Current key bindings are saved when you exit so if you unbindall then exit only the ESC key will work.)

 

[+] unbindshift  - Unbind command from a SHIFTed key.

9.  Server and Map Loading

ban [ip address] [mask] - At long last you can ban those troublesome players. Just get their ip with the status command and enter it in. However, don't get your hopes up that much at this point. It is a quick hack and can only current handle one banned ip address. It also supports higher order domain banning to make it easy to ban players from a particular ISP or site. Once you have declared at least one banned site typing ban without an ip address will list the current sites that are being banned.

To use the higher order domain banning the format is: ban xxx.xxx.0.0 xxx.xxx.0.0 (yes you have to type twice)

Once banning has been turned on you can turn it off by using the command: ban off

Thanks to Daniel A. Sill [sill@zeke.as.utexas.edu] for getting the low-down on this command.

[+] host_timescale[0.0 to 10.0]  - Scales the passage of time on client and server.  1 for normal speed, less than 1 for slow motion, and greater than 1 for fast-forward. If greater than 0, overrides host_framerate. Default 1.

hostname [name] - Sets the hostname of your computer.

kick [playername] or [# player-number] [message] - Kick a player off of your sever. You can also kick a player based on their number as listed in the status command.

0 = noexit off (people can exit at any point)
1 = noexit on (goes through the levels in order. exits the "start" map when either the fraglimit or timelimit has been reached)
2 = noexit on (players may exit into what ever episode they want from the "start" map before the fraglimit or timelimit has been reached)

restart - Restart the current level.
sv_nostep [0/1] - Toggles if players automatically walk up steps or if they have to jump up them.

sys_ticrate [value] - From techinfo.txt:
Only used by dedicated servers. This determines the rate at which the server will send out updates to the clients. The default value is 0.05 (20 updates per second.) For servers where bandwidth is limited, using modems or the internet for example, it is advisable to lower this value to 0.1 (10 updates per second.) This will have a very minor effect on responsiveness, but will half the outbound bandwidth required making the modem players a lot happier.

teamplay [value] - Toggles whether team mode is on during networked games. Set teamplay to 1 to turn this option on. Setting teamplay to 2 allows you to hurt yourself and your team, but if you kill someone on your team you lose a frag.
